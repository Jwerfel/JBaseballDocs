# Bonus

During the game you can apply bonus points to increase the chance of a good outcome.  A bonus can be applied to a contact hit, a power hit or to pitch an inning.  Using a bonus does not guarantee a good outcome but it will greatly increase the chance in your favor.

Save your bonus and use them when they are most important!
