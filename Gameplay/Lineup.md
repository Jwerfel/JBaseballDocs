# Lineup

Before you start a new game you can adjust your lineup.  Change the order of your players, change the name of the players or upgrade your players using your player points.  

Upgrading a player costs 100 player points and will upgrade the selected attribute by 10 points

During the game you cannot adjust the lineup or upgrade your players.  

If you have completed a game, press the New Game button to adjust your lineup/players.  Do this before starting the new game.
