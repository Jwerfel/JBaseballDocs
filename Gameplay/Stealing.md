# Stealing

When you have a runner on base, you can attempt to steal.  The number next to the runner indicates how fast they are.  The higher the number (up to 100), the faster they are and the more likely a steal attempt will be successful.

To steal a base, tap on the runnner on base.

You will be asked if you are sure you want to steal.  If you are sure, press Yes (Steal).

If you are successful the runner will move up a base.  If unsuccessful, they will be out.

It is easier to steal second than third.  Stealing home is very difficult.

Chose when to steal carefully but stealing bases is very important to move runners up when a batter gets a base hit.
