# Play Game

JBaseballGame is a probability based game.  You select the option and let luck take its course.  JBaseballGame of course allows you to help your odds by upgrading players and using bonus plays to help your chances.

The first time you launch the game, your lineup will be created.

Each player is assigned their abilities for contact, power and speed.  The higher the number, the better the ability.  The range is from 0 to 100.

When you complete the game, you will earn player points which can be used to upgrade players.  Play more games to gain more points to make your lineup better!

In addition to player points, after each game you complete you earn 5 bonus points.  Bonus points can be used during the game for a bonus hit, bonus power hit or a bonus pitched inning.  Using a bonus improves your chances of getting a better outcome (although using a bonus is not a guarantee).  Save your bonus and use them when they are critical in the game!
