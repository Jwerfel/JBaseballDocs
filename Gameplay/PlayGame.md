# Play Game

Your team always bats first.  To start the game, select your hit type.  Based on the abilities of the current batter and some luck will determine the out come.  If the batter gets a hit you will see them on base.  If they hit a home run you will see a celebration.  If you make an out you will see the outs increase.

After 3 outs the computer will bat and you will see how many runs they score.

The game continues for 9 innnings.  If one team is winning after 9 innings, the game is over.  If the game is tied then it will go into extra innings until there is a winner.

When the game ends, even if you lose you will earn player points (to increase your player abilities) and 10 bonus points (to use during future games).

During the game, if a runner is on base and the batter gets a hit that might score the runner, you will be given the option to try to score from third. This is a risky play but allows you to score more runs.  When asked, select Yes to try to score and No to stay at third.
