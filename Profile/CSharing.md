# Sharing

Cards you have earned can be shared with other JBaseballApp players and you can receive cards from others.  

Sharing requires you and your friend are nearby and allow networking

## Send Card to Others

When you have found a card you want to send to a friend, tap the Share button below the card.

When your friend is on the receive cards view their device name will appear as a button at the bottom of this view.  When you see their device name, tap it to send the card.  Once the card is sent you will no longer have it
