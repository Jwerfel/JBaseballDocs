# Sharing

Cards you have earned can be shared with other JBaseballApp players and you can receive cards from others.  

Sharing requires you and your friend are nearby and allow networking

## Send Card to Others

When you have found a card you want to send to a friend, tap the Share button below the card.  

When your friend is on the receive cards view their device name will appear as a button at the bottom of this view.  When you see their device name, tap it to send the card.  Once the card is sent you will no longer have it

## Receive Cards

When you are ready to receive a card, tap the Receive Cards button at the top of the cards view.  Your device will be ready to receive cards your friend sends.  Each card you receive will show on this view
