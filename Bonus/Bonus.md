# Bonus Points

During the game you can apply bonus points to increase the chance of a good outcome.  A bonus can be applied to a contact hit, a power hit or to pitch an inning.  Using a bonus does not guarantee a good outcome but it will greatly increase the chance in your favor.

Save your bonus points and use them when they are most important!

When batting, you can tap the Bonus button to apply a Contact or Power bonus
